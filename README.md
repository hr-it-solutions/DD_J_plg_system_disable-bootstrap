In the front end of Joomla! some extensions calling the function JHTML::_('behavior.tooltip'), which adds Bootstrap JavaScript to html head. To avaiod this manually by hard coding, your scripts could be broken because of an assigned "jQuery hasTooltip" function.

This plugin use the following snippet to remove:

    jQuery('.hasTooltip').tooltip({"html": true,"container": "body"});

If you know what you're doing, you can change the following snipped at plugin settings if it differs from your version!

    {"html": true,"container": "body"}

**Note:** It is not recommended to use together with Joomla! default templates like tpl_Protostar or <br>
any other template based on Bootstrap!
